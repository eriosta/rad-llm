================================================================================

Disease progressed with new lesions developing in multiple organs (adrenal, liver, pleura, vertebrae, para-aortic). Some lesions initially decreased then increased (T001, T005), while others steadily grew (T003, T004) or recurred (T008). Current status shows marked enlargement of several lesions and new involvement in multiple anatomical sites.
