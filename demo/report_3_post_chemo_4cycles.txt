RADIOLOGY REPORT

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
MRN: [REDACTED]
Date of Exam: May 22, 2024
Exam: CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST

CLINICAL HISTORY: 62-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma), status post 4 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed. Restaging study.

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained following administration of intravenous contrast material. Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.

COMPARISON: March 18, 2024

FINDINGS:

LUNGS:
The right upper lobe mass has further decreased in size, now measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm (previously 2.4 x 2.0 cm), representing an additional 25% reduction. Spiculation persists but pleural retraction appears less pronounced. Most previously identified small pulmonary nodules are no longer visualized. A single 0.3 cm nodule persists in the left lower lobe. No pleural effusion.

MEDIASTINUM:
Right paratracheal lymph node has further decreased to 1.0 x 0.7 cm (previously 1.3 x 0.9 cm). Subcarinal lymph node now measures 0.9 x 0.6 cm (previously 1.2 x 0.8 cm), now within normal size limits. No pericardial effusion.

LIVER:
The liver demonstrates homogeneous enhancement without focal lesions. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

GALLBLADDER:
Unremarkable without stones or wall thickening.

SPLEEN:
Normal in size and enhancement pattern. No focal lesions.

ADRENALS:
The right adrenal nodule has decreased slightly to 1.0 cm (previously 1.2 cm). Left adrenal gland remains normal.

PANCREAS:
Normal size and enhancement. No pancreatic ductal dilatation or peripancreatic fluid.

KIDNEYS:
Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis, masses, or stones.

MESENTERIC VESSELS:
Patent without evidence of aneurysm or dissection.

BOWEL:
Non-distended bowel loops without wall thickening or obstruction.

REPRODUCTIVE:
Prostate is normal in size for age.

URINARY:
Bladder is partially distended and unremarkable.

OTHER:
No free air or fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.

LYMPH NODES:
Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes, stable and not pathologically enlarged.

BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:
No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions. Stable mild degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Continued partial response to chemotherapy with further 25% reduction in the right upper lobe primary mass, now measuring 1.8 cm (44% reduction from baseline).
2. Near complete resolution of pulmonary metastases with only a single small 0.3 cm nodule remaining.
3. Continued decrease in mediastinal lymph nodes, with subcarinal node now normal in size.
4. Slight decrease in right adrenal nodule, consistent with metastasis responding to therapy.

RECOMMENDATION: Excellent response to therapy. Continue current regimen with maintenance pemetrexed. Repeat staging CT in 3 months.
