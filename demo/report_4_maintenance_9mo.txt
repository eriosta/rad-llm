RADIOLOGY REPORT

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
MRN: [REDACTED]
Date of Exam: August 28, 2024
Exam: CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST

CLINICAL HISTORY: 62-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma), on maintenance pemetrexed therapy. Surveillance imaging.

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained following administration of intravenous contrast material. Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.

COMPARISON: May 22, 2024

FINDINGS:

LUNGS:
The right upper lobe mass is stable in size, measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm (unchanged from prior). Spiculated margins persist with minimal pleural retraction. The single 0.3 cm nodule in the left lower lobe remains stable. No new pulmonary nodules. No pleural effusion.

MEDIASTINUM:
Right paratracheal lymph node is stable at 1.0 x 0.7 cm. Subcarinal lymph node measures 0.9 x 0.6 cm, unchanged. No pericardial effusion.

LIVER:
The liver demonstrates homogeneous enhancement without focal lesions. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

GALLBLADDER:
Unremarkable without stones or wall thickening.

SPLEEN:
Normal in size and enhancement pattern. No focal lesions.

ADRENALS:
The right adrenal nodule is stable at 1.0 cm. Left adrenal gland remains normal.

PANCREAS:
Normal size and enhancement. No pancreatic ductal dilatation or peripancreatic fluid.

KIDNEYS:
Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis, masses, or stones.

MESENTERIC VESSELS:
Patent without evidence of aneurysm or dissection.

BOWEL:
Non-distended bowel loops without wall thickening or obstruction.

REPRODUCTIVE:
Prostate is normal in size for age.

URINARY:
Bladder is partially distended and unremarkable.

OTHER:
No free air or fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.

LYMPH NODES:
Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes, stable and not pathologically enlarged.

BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:
No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions. Stable mild degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable disease with no change in the right upper lobe primary mass (1.8 cm) or left lower lobe nodule.
2. Stable mediastinal lymph nodes, not meeting criteria for pathologic enlargement.
3. Stable right adrenal metastasis.
4. No evidence of disease progression. No new sites of disease.

RECOMMENDATION: Continue maintenance therapy. Repeat staging CT in 3 months.
